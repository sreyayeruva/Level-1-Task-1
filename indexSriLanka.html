            <p style="font-size:20px"; style="font-style:30px";>Sri Dalada Maligawa is the Sinhalese name for this holy shrine. Famously called Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, it is touted to be the most sacred Buddhist temple in the whole world. It houses the tooth of Buddha nestled in a golden chamber and is within the premises of the royal palace complex (formerly a princely state). Kandy is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it is said that whichever state holds the tooth relic, maintains an essential place in the governance of the country.  </p>
             <p style="font-size:20px"; style="font-style:30px";>The ambience inside is exceptionally cosy and welcoming; it enthrals with the smells of fresh flowers, and coconut oil lit candles and lamps. Within the temple, the daily pujas are carried out in the ground floor consisting of the Pallemaluwa. On Wednesdays, the bathing of the relic with a herbal preparation (scented water and fragrant flowers) takes place. It is called the Nanumura Mangallaya. This holy water is of substantial spiritual reverence and is distributed among the devotees. </p>

            <p style="font-size:20px"; style="font-style:30px";>Declared a world heritage site by UNESCO, Sigiriya serves as a fine example of ancient urban planning. Sigiriya is a significant site of the Cultural Triangle and perhaps Sri Lanka’s most iconic historical destination. The site, also known as Lion Rock, is recognized all over the world for the remains of the ancient Sigiriya Rock Fortress and its numerous enchanting and well-preserved attractions. The complex hydraulics system at the fortress enhances the site’s reputation as a beautiful example of classical city planning.</p>
             <p style="font-size:20px"; style="font-style:30px";>It is located in the Matale district in the centre near the town called Dambulla. According to history, this site was chosen by the king Kasyapa to serve as his new capital. There is a huge gateway shaped like a lion and the place derives its name from this gateway. This place served as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century.</p>
