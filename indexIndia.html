            <p style="font-size:20px"; style="font-style:60px";>The Taj Mahal is one of the seven wonders of the world and is considered to be the most popular tourist attraction in the country.
               A symbol of love, the Taj was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for his queen Mumtaz.
                Tagore described the Taj as a "teardrop on the cheek of eternity". 
                The monument attracts a lot of tourists all around the year.</p>
             <p style="font-size:20px"; style="font-style:30px";>If there was just one symbol to represent all of India, it would be the Taj Mahal. The monument inspires millions of tourists to make the trip to Agra every year, waking up before dawn to see magnificent structure radiate at sunrise. But Agra tops the list of the best places to visit in India for reasons that go beyond India's most famous attraction.</p>

            <p style="font-size:20px"; style="font-style:30px";> Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.</p>
             <p style="font-size:20px"; style="font-style:30px";>On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.</p>
